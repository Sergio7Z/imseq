{"name":"IMSEQ","tagline":"Rapid and error aware immunogenetic sequence analysis","body":"### IMSEQ\r\n\r\nIMSEQ is a **fast, PCR and sequencing error aware** tool to analyze high throughput data from recombined **T-cell receptor** or **immunoglobolin** gene **sequencing** experiments. It derives immune **repertoires** from sequencing data in FASTA / FASTQ format.\r\n\r\n![IMSEQ Workflow](./images/imseq-flow.png)\r\n\r\n#### Getting IMSEQ\r\n\r\nYou can obtain binaries and sources for the latest release, **IMSEQ 1.0**, by choosing from one of the following links:\r\n\r\n * [**IMSEQ 1.0 for Linux (64 bit)**](./binaries/imseq-1.0-linux64.tgz)<br/>Statically linked binary supporting most 64 bit Linux systems\r\n * [**IMSEQ 1.0 for OS X (64 bit)**](./binaries/imseq-1.0-mac64.tgz)<br/>Requires OS X 10.9 or newer\r\n * [**IMSEQ 1.0 Sourcecode**](./binaries/imseq-1.0-source.tgz)<br/>A source tarball of IMSEQ 1.0. For the sources and build instructions of the current development version check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lkuchenb/imseq).\r\n \r\n#### Using IMSEQ\r\n\r\n**IMSEQ** requires at least two input files and the specification of at least one output file. The two input files are specified using the switches\r\n```\r\n$ imseq -ref segment-reference.fa -o output-file.tsv input-file.fastq.gz\r\n```\r\n<p></p>\r\n * _segment-reference.fa_<br/>A file containing the ***V and J segment sequences*** for the gene and species that is analyzed. The file must be in FASTA format and the sequence IDs must follow the [IMSEQ FASTA ID Specification](). Gene segment reference files for the human T-cell receptor alpha and beta chain genes are provided with **IMSEQ**.\r\n * _input-file.fastq.gz_<br/>One (single-end sequencing) or two (split paired-end sequencing) FASTA or FASTQ files with the input reads. If two files are specified, the first file is considered to be V-read and the second file the V(D)J-read, if only one file is specified it has to contain V(D)J-reads. V-reads are parsed as forward sequence, V(D)J-reads are parsed as reverse complementary sequence. This behavior can be inversed using the ```-r``` switch.\r\n * _output-file.tsv_<br/>An output file where the detailed per-read analysis results are written in TSV format. See [IMSEQ Output file specifications]() for more details.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
