{"name":"IMSEQ","tagline":"Rapid and error aware immunogenetic sequence analysis","body":"### IMSEQ\r\n\r\nIMSEQ is a **fast, PCR and sequencing error aware** tool to analyze high throughput data from recombined **T-cell receptor** or **immunoglobolin** gene **sequencing** experiments. It derives immune **repertoires** from sequencing data in FASTA / FASTQ format.\r\n\r\n![IMSEQ Workflow](./images/imseq-flow.png)\r\n\r\n#### Getting IMSEQ\r\n\r\nYou can obtain binaries and sources for the latest release, **IMSEQ 1.0**, by choosing from one of the following links:\r\n\r\n * [**IMSEQ 1.0 for Linux (64 bit)**](./binaries/imseq-1.0-linux64.tgz)<br/>Statically linked binary supporting most 64 bit Linux systems\r\n * [**IMSEQ 1.0 for OS X (64 bit)**](./binaries/imseq-1.0-mac64.tgz)<br/>Requires OS X 10.9 or newer\r\n * [**IMSEQ 1.0 Sourcecode**](./binaries/imseq-1.0-source.tgz)<br/>A source tarball of IMSEQ 1.0. For the sources and build instructions of the current development version check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lkuchenb/imseq).\r\n \r\n#### Using IMSEQ\r\n\r\n**IMSEQ** requires at least two input files and the specification of at least one output file. The two input files are specified using the switches\r\n```\r\n$ imseq -ref segment-reference.fa -o output-file.tsv input-file.fastq.gz\r\n```\r\n<p></p>\r\n * _segment-reference.fa_<br/>A file containing the ***V and J segment sequences*** for the gene and species that is analyzed. The file must be in FASTA format and the sequence IDs must follow the [IMSEQ FASTA ID Specification](). Gene segment reference files for the human T-cell receptor alpha and beta chain genes are provided with **IMSEQ**.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
