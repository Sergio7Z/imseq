# Tutorials

**[Tutorial 1: Basic usage of IMSEQ](/ugm/tut1)**<br/>
In this tutorial, a small example file with 50 simulated full gene sequences is used to illustrate the basic usage of **IMSEQ**.

**[Tutorial 2: Standalone error correction](/ugm/tut2)**<br/>
Based on an example file with 10,000 real world sequencing reads of particularly poor quality, in this tutorial you will learn how to use the standalone error correction features of **IMSEQ** and how strongly sequencing errors can falsify immune repertoire distributions.

**[Tutorial 3: Barcode based error correction](/ugm/tut3)**<br/>
Preferably, errors should be corrected using stretches of random nucleotides incorporated in the PCR primers used for the very first enrichment PCR. **IMSEQ** can use these PCR barcodes to correct sequencing and PCR errors as well as to provide a more accurate clonotype distribution. The corresponding command line options for this type of analysis are demonstrated in this tutorial.
